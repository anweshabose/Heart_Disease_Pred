Here are the complete names of the columns in your heart disease prediction dataset:
- age – Age in years
- sex – Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
- cp – Chest pain type (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain
Here are the complete names of the columns in your heart disease prediction dataset:
- age – Age in years
- sex – Gender (1 = male, 0 = female)
- cp – Chest pain type (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic)
- trestbps – Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- chol – Serum cholesterol (in mg/dl)
- fbs – Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false)
- restecg – Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = probable left ventricular hypertrophy)
- thalach – Maximum heart rate achieved
- exang – Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- oldpeak – ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- slope – Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping)
- ca – Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy
- thal – Thalassemia (1 = normal, 3 = fixed defect, 6 = reversible defect)
- target – Presence of heart disease (1 = disease, 0 = no disease)

This dataset is widely used for heart disease prediction models. Given your experience with statistical modeling and visualization, you might find it insightful to analyze correlations between features using Seaborn heatmaps or pair plots. Would you like help with that?
